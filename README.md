# -Q-Learning-in-Deep-Learning
This project is on Q learning using python.

To determine the best action-selection strategy for a given finite Markov decision process, machine learning uses the model-free reinforcement learning method known as Q-learning. Q-learning is extended to handle complicated, high-dimensional state spaces in deep learning, particularly in the context of deep reinforcement learning.
